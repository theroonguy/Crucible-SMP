The Crucible SMP is a private Vanilla+ Minecraft server that aims to remove the grind from building through resource generators and instead encourage cooperation and communities, while simultaneously fueling conflict between various nations. Hopefully, this will give new purposes to building, exploring, and interacting with other players. With over 30 players invited (and counting), you’ll easily find a group of players to mesh with. (Recommended: Fabulously Optimized Modpack)
